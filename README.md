# GifTastic

GifTastic is a Simpsons themed Gif Generator.

## How to use:

Click on one of the buttons labeled with a character name to view ten relevant GIFs from GIPHY. If you would like to see GIFs from a character that does not already have a button, you can create a new button. Pease fill out and submit the "add a character" field in the center of the screen. You can then click on the newly created button to generate GIFs from that character. All GIFs initially load as still images. To animate the Gif, click on it.
